# Sentimental_Analysis

Sentiment is a machine learning (AI) model that measures consumer satisfaction based on a huge number of customer interactions. It is also known as opinion mining that employs natural language processing to assess whether data is positive, negative, or neutral. It is a proven predictive indicator of customer satisfaction and can be used to analyze processes, behaviors, products, and more for optimal customer experiences and operational efficiency. Businesses frequently utilize it to detect sentiment in social data, assess brand reputation, and gain a better understanding of their customers.
Sentiment analysis is becoming a crucial tool for monitoring and understanding client sentiment as they share their opinions and feelings more openly than ever before. Brands can learn what makes customers happy or frustrated by automatically evaluating customer feedback, such as comments in survey replies and social media dialogues. This allows them to customize products and services to match their customers' demands. With this project I can learn the machine learning models which are to be performed on the dataset and positive and negative outlook of people regarding a topic.
